title: Chroma
description:
  The Chroma package supports data-parallel programming constructs for lattice field theory and in particular lattice QCD.
  It uses the SciDAC QDP++ data-parallel programming (in C++) that presents a single high-level code image to the user,
  but can generate highly optimized code for many architectural systems including single node workstations, multi and many-core nodes, clusters of nodes via QMP, and classic vector computers.
